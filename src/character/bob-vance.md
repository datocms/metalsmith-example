Bob Vance owns a refrigeration business in the same office building that Dunder Mifflin occupies. He always introduces himself as “Bob Vance, Vance Refrigeration” even when meeting multiple people at one time. This is perhaps trying to use the documentary crew as free advertising for his business. He gets engaged and later marries Phyllis.

In “Search Committee,” Phyllis reveals that she got Bob to notice her by walking into his office wearing nothing but cat ears for nine days in a row, but on the tenth day she saw Bob waiting for her in nothing but a dog nose. Now that’s love.

Bob finds Michael annoying and refers to him, Dwight and Andy as jackasses. In “Fun Run” Phyllis mentions that Bob likes to keep things “spicy” and this is shown during a double date with Jim and Pam in “Blood Drive” when the two sneak off to have sex in the restaurant’s bathroom.

As a business owner, he is very wealthy and even offers to buy a hug Phyllis auctioned off in “Crime Aid” for $1,000.
