Phyllis Vance is a soft-spoken, but friendly Sales Rep for Dunder Mifflin. Portrayed as somewhat meek, she proves to be a savvy sales woman. But she’s a hard worker who won the Dundie for busiest beaver, although there was a typo on the trophy.

Michael often ridicules Phyllis for being old even though they were in the same high school class. Michael may do this to keep him from thinking about how old he is getting. Phyllis marries Bob Vance in Season 3 and hints that they have a rather feisty relationship.

Like Stanley, she prefers to stay out of office conflicts. She has a very sweet disposition but when pushed she can be very conniving like when she blackmailed Angela in Season 5 after catching her cheating on Andy with Dwight. She takes her place as head of the party planning committee and she enjoys pushing Angela around.

Phyllis plays to Michael’s ego by putting him in her wedding and therefore getting a six-week vacation for her honeymoon even though he did his best to ruin every precious moment.
