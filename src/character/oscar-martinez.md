Oscar is an intelligent accountant for Dunder Mifflin but is also very opinionated and often a target for Michael’s ridicule because he is gay. Michael accidentally outs Oscar in “Gay Witch Hunt” before trying to apologize and show the office he is okay with Oscar being gay by forcing Oscar to kiss him. To avoid a lawsuit, Jan gives Oscar a settlement and a paid vacation.

Like Pam, Oscar tries to be the voice of reason in the office and puts up with Michael’s antics while enduring off-color jokes for being gay and being Mexican. He often tries to rally people to see reason like in “The Surplus” he tried to convince his co-workers to vote for a new copier and in “Prince Paper” he gives a speech stating why he doesn’t think Hilary Swank is hot.
