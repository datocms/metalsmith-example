  The Office is an American television comedy series that originally aired on
  the National Broadcasting Company from March 24, 2005 to May 16, 2013. It is
  an adaptation of the BBC series of the same name. The series depicts the
  everyday lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the
  fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.


  The first season of The Office was met with mixed reviews, but the following
  four seasons received widespread acclaim from television critics, and were
  included on several critics' year-end top TV series lists, winning several
  awards including four Primetime Emmy Awards, including Outstanding Comedy
  Series in 2006. While later seasons were criticized for a decline in quality,
  earlier writers oversaw the final season and ended the show's run with a
  positive reception.
